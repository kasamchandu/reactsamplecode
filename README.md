## Instructions

#### Database

We currently support mySQL, as well as the ability to not use any database.

#### Development

Development is a breeze. Once you have installed all your dependencies all the configuration is done for you. 

For dependencies we need to run the command

npm install

# Run in watch mode
npm test:watch
```
npm start

We have unit tests for async (redux) actions, reducers, and components.
